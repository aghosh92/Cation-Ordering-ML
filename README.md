1. How Random Forest Classification models can be trained and tested on a DFT-based dataset followed by visualizing trees 
and downselecting important features.

2. Probabilistic confidence bound along with interactive plots can be utilized to test accuracies of models.

3. How causal networks can be constructed using the important features to investigate structure-property relationships.

How SISSO approach can be implemented within a regression environment to find the best combination of non-linearized 
features with respect to the target using Matminer and Automatminer.
